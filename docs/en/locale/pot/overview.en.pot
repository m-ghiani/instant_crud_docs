msgid "`instant_crud` is a **robust framework or library** meticulously designed with the primary goal of **simplifying and drastically accelerating the development of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations**. Its main focus lies in the **rapid and efficient construction of web APIs**. Thanks to its **highly modular architecture**, `instant_crud` provides a **complete and cohesive set of reusable components** covering critical and fundamental functionalities for any modern application, such as **authentication**, **data management**, **endpoint routing**, and **sophisticated centralized error handling**. This modularity not only ensures code reusability but also contributes to a clean and maintainable architecture."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:7
msgid "The core objective of `instant_crud` is to **optimize and speed up the CRUD development process**, including the **management of complex relationships, especially many-to-many**. This is achieved through a modular architecture and specific components designed to abstract complexity and automate much of the repetitive work typically associated with such tasks."

#: ../../overview.en.md:11
msgid "The main features of `instant_crud` are at the heart of its value, offering concrete solutions to common challenges in API development:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:13
msgid "**1. Rapid Generation of CRUD APIs**   `instant_crud` is optimized to allow developers to **quickly create fully functional CRUD endpoints with minimal boilerplate code**. This is made possible by strategic components like `crud_router.py` and `base_service.py`, which **significantly reduce the development time** required for implementing standard data management interfaces."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:15
msgid "**`crud_router.py`**: A **generic router class** capable of automatically exposing standard CRUD endpoints for any provided data model. Instead of manually writing routes, developers can generate them automatically."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:16
msgid "*Example*: Instantiating `CRUDRouter(model=User, service=UserService)` automatically generates:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:17
msgid "`GET /users` (list all users)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:18
msgid "`GET /users/{id}` (get user by ID)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:19
msgid "`POST /users` (create new user)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:20
msgid "`PUT /users/{id}` (update user)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:21
msgid "`DELETE /users/{id}` (delete user)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:22
msgid "**`base_service.py`**: A **base service class** encapsulating common business logic operations. These services often interact with `BaseRepository`, abstracting CRUD logic from the routing layer to keep the code clean and modular."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:24
msgid "**2. Comprehensive Authentication and Authorization**   `instant_crud` offers **built-in support for modern security paradigms**, ensuring secure access control."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:26
msgid "**JWT-based Authentication**: Stateless session management using JSON Web Tokens. The `jwt_handler.py` module handles **token creation, encoding, decoding, and validation**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:27
msgid "**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Provides **granular user permission management**. The `role_checker.py` module implements the RBAC logic, verifying user permissions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:28
msgid "The `instant_crud/auth/` module includes decorators such as `@jwt_required` and `@roles_required([\"admin\", \"editor\"])` to easily enforce security controls on API endpoints."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:30
msgid "**3. Flexible and Abstracted Data Access Layer**   The framework is **database-agnostic**, compatible with different persistence technologies via well-defined repository interfaces:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:32
msgid "**`base_repository.py` and `repository_interfaces.py`** define the base repository contract."

msgid "**DuckDB** for **in-process analytical queries**, ideal for fast data analysis without external DB servers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:37
msgid "**4. Advanced Data Filtering Capabilities**   `instant_crud` supports **complex filtering via a JSON-based query language**, enabling flexible and dynamic data retrieval through the `instant_crud/filters/` module."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:39
msgid "*Example*: `?filter={\"name\":{\"$eq\":\"Alice\"},\"age\":{\"$gt\":25}}` is parsed and translated into a valid DB query. Supported operators include `$eq`, `$ne`, `$gt`, `$in`, `$contains`."

msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:50
msgid "Categorizes, manages, and propagates application errors consistently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:51
msgid "*Example*: `RepositoryNotFoundError` becomes a `404 Not Found` HTTP response. Error codes (e.g., `ERROR_CODE_AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS = 1001`) facilitate client-side error handling."
msgstr ""

#: ../../overview.en.md:53

Not only does it facilitate the creation of standard APIs, but it also provides **robust support for complex relationships (particularly many-to-many)**, **JWT and RBAC-based authentication**, **flexible and database-agnostic data persistence**, and a **centralized and granular error management system**. By abstracting underlying complexities and automating much of the repetitive work, `instant_crud` enables developers to focus on their applicationâ€™s unique business logic, **significantly reducing development time** and improving code quality."
